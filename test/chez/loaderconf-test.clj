;; specification of clojure.core. They are written against the public API only,
;; so a rewrite underneath is free as long as the suite stays green.
;;
;; Run: bin/jolt run test/chez/loaderconf-test.clj  (make loaderconf gates it
;; against test/chez/loaderconf-known-failures.txt).
;;
;; Each case prints one CASE line; a case passes only if every check in it
;; passed and it did not throw. The gate compares the PASS/FAIL set against the
;; recorded baseline, so a case going green fails the gate until the baseline
;; says so, and a case going red fails it always.
